## Hi there, I'm Zion! ðŸ‘‹

### About Me 
I am a MASc student at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering in the University of Toronto with my research focusing primarily on biomaterials development for applications in regenerative medicine. However, I am generally passionate for any sort of work that has clear translational impact. 

I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, graduating with an HBSc specializing in chemistry along with a major in philosophy (focuses on metaphysics and philosophy of mind). My chemistry studies were primarily in analytical, polymer and some physical chemistry. 

My previous research experience includes work on digital immunoassay development and aspects of chemical laboratory automation. As such, I hold experience in: 
- Microfluidic / lab-on-a-chip technology design and development
- Microscopy and biological image processing/analysis
- Electronics for chemical and biosensor design
